# Blogging Pact

This repo is to record our successes and failures in our blogging pact.

We've decided to put $1 into a pot every week. When someone doesn't blog, the other person gets the pot. The deadline is 11:59 every Monday night. (Occasionally, we'll extend the deadline by a day or 2 if everyone agrees.) A pull request must be submitted by that time.

There's no restriction on the topics of the blog posts. They don't even need to always be written to the same blog. (You might want to have a personal blog and a business or technical blog.) The only restriction is that the blog entry be at least 200 words long. A 30-minute podcast episode will also be acceptable. Blog entries and podcasts must be published publically.

We'll keep a list of blog entries here.
